# Mario-Kart-Race-Simulator
This is my final program for my object-oriented programming class.

It was a group project with my parnter Eve Collier. 

This program uses JavaFX to present a graphic user interface that displays a main menu. This main menu gives you four options: race, register competitor,
quit, and display competitors. It's not very pretty, but it demonstrates the ability to learn a completely foreign concept in a short period of time. We were 
able to create this program alongside individual calculators also using JavaFX. Below is a brief description of each option.

RACE:   Displays a window with an option for four maps: Dolphin Shoals, Mount Wario, Sunshine Airport, and Electrodrome. Once you click on one, a video plays to
        simulate a race taking place there.
        
REGISTER COMPETITOR:    This is just as it sounds, it registers a competitor. It asks for ID, first and last name, character, and vehicle. It is a little buggy
                        because of the difference in resolution and screen size. We originally programmed this on a Mac.

DISPLAY COMPETITORS:    This simply displays all currently registered competitors.

QUIT:    This exits the program.
